        <p>We meet bi-weekly during the semester to discuss academic papers in the field of Ethical AI. Participation is open to all and guests are always welcome! Meetings will be held in the EPAI discord voice channel paper-reading-meeting-room. To join the EPAI Discord server, please click <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://discord.com/invite/kJZTVpBCcP">here</a></u>.</p>
        <p>Each meeting, the paper reading group will discuss a different paper. The chosen paper will be announced two weeks in advance by the organizer in the Discord channel #paper-reading. All participants are expected to read the paper before the meeting. It is recommended that you <b>bring at least one (1) discussion point</b> to the meeting. You are not expected to spend more than an hour reading the paper. Here is a blogpost on <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/ai-saturdays/how-to-read-academic-papers-without-freaking-out-3f7ef43a070f">How to Read Academic Papers</a></u>.</p>
        <p>The goals of the paper reading group are:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Exposure to the field of ethics in AI</li>
                <li>Critical reflection on scientific work</li>
                <li>Practice of reading and argumentation strategies</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The discussion is limited to <b>one hour</b> and is led by a moderator, who sets the focus of the discussion and is typically the one who picks the paper. The moderator will kick off the meeting by giving a short summary of the paper and raising a few points for discussion. The moderator will try to incorporate all participants in the discussion.</p>
