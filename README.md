# EPAI Website
This repo contains the code for EPAI's React based website in the "main" branch.
When compiled the code is deployed to the "gh-pages" branch as that is where the code is hosted from.

## Usage
In order to run this site locally for editing or testing purposes you can do the following:

1. Pull the GitHub Repository to your local machine
2. Open your local instance of this repo and Run `npm install` in your terminal to install the necessary npm packages for the site
3. You can now run `npm start` to run the site on your localhost. A window should automatically open for this.
4. You're now free to edit the website and view live changes on your local instance. 
###### Important:
Before making edits ensure you have pulled the current version of the website to avoid conflicts if someone else has made changes.
After making edits ensure that you push to the repo. Either in a separate branch to be merged with the main or directly to main if you only made small tweaks.

5. When you are happy with your changes you can run `npm run deploy` to deploy the site to the GitHub Pages delpoyment.
